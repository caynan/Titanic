This is to explain where everything is. If you look into requirement.txt, it will show you the libraries that need to be
installed to run the code (open using Word, it is all run together in notepad). The data folder holds the training data
(the test.csv file is not used for our programs). Our algorithms are located in the code folder. There is a separate 
README file in the code folder explaining the code further. In a command prompt, navigate to the code folder. Once there,
run the code: python RandomForest.py    
              python support_vector_machine.py
  
  If the libraries are installed, the code should execute without a problem.
